# SolarEnergy_Statistics
Machine Learning Project 
## Project Overview
This project analyzes global solar and hydroelectric energy consumption trends across different countries, with a focus on identifying relationships with GDP and population metrics. Using various machine learning models, the project predicts solar energy consumption and energy prices, aiming to provide insights that support the shift toward renewable energy solutions. This project also integrates synthetic data and applies cross-validation techniques to improve model accuracy.
## Objectives
Visualize global energy consumption trends in solar and hydroelectric sectors.
Compare energy consumption patterns with economic indicators like GDP and population.
Forecast future solar consumption using machine learning models.
Predict energy prices using different predictive models.
Enhance prediction accuracy with synthetic data and cross-validation techniques.

## Dataset
The project utilizes datasets containing:

Country-wise energy consumption data, including solar, hydroelectric usage, GDP, and population metrics.
Energy data by Indian state, including energy generation and price metrics.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in renewable energy forecasting, with ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperforming traditional models. The integration of synthetic data and cross-validation further enhances the reliability of predictions. These findings can inform energy policy and support a data-driven transition toward sustainable energy use globally.
